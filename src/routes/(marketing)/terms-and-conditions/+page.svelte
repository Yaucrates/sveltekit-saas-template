	<p>
		The Platform collects usage data, engagement metrics, and learning analytics to improve our
		Services, understand learning patterns, and help Instructors identify students who may need
		additional support. This includes tracking your interactions with course content, time on task,
		submission patterns, and performance trends.
	</p>

	<h2 id="platform-security">8. Code Execution Environment and Platform Security</h2>

	<h3>Sandboxed Code Execution</h3>

	<p>
		The Platform includes a code execution environment that allows you to write, run, and test code
		as part of your learning activities. All code is executed in a secure, sandboxed environment
		with the following characteristics:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Isolation:</strong> Your code runs in an isolated container, separate from our production
			systems and other users' code.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Resource Limits:</strong> Code execution is subject to resource limits, including CPU
			time, memory usage, execution duration, and network access restrictions.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Security Controls:</strong> The sandbox environment implements security controls to prevent
			unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and malicious activity.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<strong>You agree that you will NOT attempt to:</strong>
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Break out of the sandbox or bypass security restrictions.</li>
		<li>
			Access, modify, or interfere with the underlying infrastructure, operating system, or other
			users' environments.
		</li>
		<li>
			Perform resource exhaustion attacks, such as fork bombs, infinite loops designed to consume
			resources, or excessive memory allocation.
		</li>
		<li>Scan networks, probe ports, or attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
		<li>Mine cryptocurrency or use Platform resources for purposes other than learning.</li>
		<li>Execute malicious code designed to harm the Platform or other systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Violations of these security rules may result in immediate Account termination and may be
		reported to appropriate authorities.
	</p>

	<h3>Code Playback and Session Recording</h3>

	<p>
		To support academic integrity and provide detailed feedback, the Platform may record your
		coding sessions, including:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Keystroke sequences and code changes over time.</li>
		<li>Timestamps of edits and submissions.</li>
		<li>Code compilation attempts and error messages.</li>
		<li>Time spent on assignments and activity patterns.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These recordings may be accessed by your Instructors and Institution to review your work
		process, investigate suspected academic misconduct, and understand your learning progression.
		Code playback data is treated as educational data subject to our Privacy Policy and applicable
		privacy laws.
	</p>

	<h3>Plagiarism Detection</h3>

	<p>
		The Platform uses plagiarism detection technology similar to MOSS (Measure of Software
		Similarity) to analyze code submissions and identify potential similarities with:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Other submissions within the same course.</li>
		<li>Submissions from previous course offerings.</li>
		<li>Code available on the internet and in public repositories.</li>
		<li>Known solution databases.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Plagiarism detection results, including similarity scores and matched code segments, are shared
		with Instructors to support academic integrity enforcement. However, you acknowledge that:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Plagiarism detection tools are not perfect and may produce false positives.</li>
		<li>Similarity does not automatically prove plagiarism or academic misconduct.</li>
		<li>
			Instructors are responsible for reviewing plagiarism detection results and making final
			determinations about academic integrity violations.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Platform Availability and Uptime</h3>

	<p>
		While we strive to maintain high availability of the Platform, we do not guarantee 100% uptime
		or uninterrupted access. The Platform may be unavailable due to:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Scheduled maintenance windows.</li>
		<li>Emergency maintenance or security updates.</li>
		<li>Infrastructure failures or service provider outages.</li>
		<li>Distributed denial-of-service attacks or other security incidents.</li>
		<li>Force majeure events beyond our reasonable control.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of scheduled maintenance in advance. However, you
		acknowledge that temporary unavailability may occur, and you should not rely on continuous
		access to the Platform for time-sensitive submissions. We recommend submitting assignments well
		before deadlines to account for potential technical issues.

			<strong>Automated grading may contain errors or inaccuracies.</strong> Auto-graders use algorithms

			incorrectly assessed your work, you should promptly notify your Instructor for manual review.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>No guarantee of grading accuracy.</strong> We do not guarantee that auto-grading will
			be accurate, fair, or consistent in all cases.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Your access to the Platform will be immediately revoked.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2 id="governing-law">14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

	<h3>Governing Law</h3>

	<p>
		If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you waive any right
