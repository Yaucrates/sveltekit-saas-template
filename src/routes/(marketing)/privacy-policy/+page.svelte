	<p class="text-stone-600">
		<strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 28, 2026
	</p>

	<p>
		Impart is committed to protecting the privacy of everyone whose information we process. We
		strive to process all personal information compliantly, ethically, and with the highest
		standards of professionalism and responsibility.
	</p>

	<p>
		Impart collects and processes personal information to deliver our courseware platform and
		educational services. We may also use this information to analyze and improve our services,
		conduct marketing activities, organize events, and support our business operations.
	</p>

	<p>
		This notice explains how Impart collects, uses, and shares personal information. It also
		explains how you can exercise choice and control over your own information.
	</p>

	<p>
		Impart operates primarily in the United States but may process data internationally through our
		cloud infrastructure. If applicable to you, please see the important information provided
		throughout this policy regarding international data transfers and regional privacy laws.
	</p>

	<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>

	<p>
		When we refer to "Impart," "our," "we," or "us," we mean Impart Inc. and its subsidiaries and
		affiliates.
	</p>

	<p>
		In many situations, Impart provides services for educational institutions such as schools,
		universities, and other academic organizations. In these cases, Impart may act as a "Processor"
		(or "Service Provider") under the instruction of those institutions. The institution, often
		referred to as the "Controller," holds overall responsibility for processing personal
		information. If you submit an enquiry or request to Impart that needs to be forwarded to your
		institution, we will let you know.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have questions about how Impart uses your personal information, please contact us at <a
			href="mailto:support@imparteducation.com">support@imparteducation.com</a
		>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="types-of-information">1. Types of Personal Information We Process</h2>

	<p>
		Personal information, also called "personal data" in some countries, means any information
		relating to an identified or identifiable person. The types of personal information we process
		depend on how people interact with us and the services we provide. This section explains the
		types of personal information we may process to deliver our services.
	</p>

	<p>The types of personal information we process include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Identifiers</strong>, such as name, username, email address, IP address, or student
			identification numbers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Contact information</strong>, such as email address, postal address, and telephone
			number.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Demographic information</strong>, such as age or gender.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Academic information</strong>, such as course enrollment, grades, assignment
			submissions, progress tracking, quiz and test results, and areas of study.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Financial information</strong> associated with payment.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Engagement information</strong>, such as content you provide to us, comments,
			feedback, forum posts, enquiries, and other communications.

			type, operating system, referring URLs, pages viewed, and usage patterns (as detailed in the
			"Sources of Personal Information" section below).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Preferences</strong>, such as communication preferences, language preferences, or
			learning preferences.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Some of the personal information we process may be classified as sensitive personal information.
		This definition varies according to local data protection laws. We will only process such
		information when necessary for a specific and legitimate purpose, and in line with applicable
		requirements.
	</p>

	<h2 id="sources-of-information">2. Sources of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>
		We collect personal information in different ways: directly from you, through automated
		technologies, or from other sources. This section explains more about our sources of personal
		information.
	</p>

	<h3>Information Provided Directly</h3>

	<p>
		We collect personal information directly from people who use our platform or services, visit our
		offices, or communicate with us. All information we ask for is mandatory unless marked as
		optional. If mandatory information is not provided, we may be unable to provide the requested
		service.
	</p>

	<h3>Information Collected Through Automated Technologies</h3>

	<p>
		We collect personal information when our platform and websites are used, either directly or
		through our third-party analytics providers. This includes IP address, browser type and
		settings, device details, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, platform content
		interactions, location data, and other usage information. We use tracking technologies such as
		cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, and device recognition technologies. We use this
		information to enable platform functionality, understand usage trends, personalize user
		experiences, improve our services, and ensure platform security.
	</p>

	<h3>Information From Other Sources</h3>

	<p>
		We receive personal information from third parties such as: educational institutions that
		provide access to Impart for their students; business partners; advertising and marketing
		agencies; analytics providers; payment processors; cloud infrastructure providers; and email
		service providers.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you choose to register and sign in using a third-party account (like Google or Microsoft),
		that service handles your authentication. We will collect your name, email, and any other
		information you agree to share when you link your third-party account.
	</p>

	<h2 id="use-of-information">3. Use of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>
		Depending on how people interact with Impart, we use personal information for various purposes.
		This includes fulfilling contracts, meeting legal requirements, where consent has been given, or
		for legitimate business needs (if allowed by relevant jurisdictional law). This section explains
		the purposes for using personal information and the grounds that permit such use.

	</p>

	<p>
		Impart does not make decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on individuals
		using solely automated means without human review. If such decisions are made in any particular
		instance, we will provide information about how the decision is made, its consequences, and how
		to request a human review.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may combine or anonymize information so that it can't identify individuals. This
		de-identified information may be used for analysis, such as developing our educational products
		and services, identifying learning trends, improving educational outcomes, and benchmarking.
		Where allowed by law, we may share de-identified information with third parties as described in
		the "Sharing Personal Information" section below.
	</p>

	<h3>Grounds for Processing</h3>

		<li>To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
		<li>To perform a task in the public interest (such as providing educational services).</li>

	</ul>

	<h2 id="sharing-information">4. Sharing Personal Information</h2>

	<p>
		We may need to share personal information within Impart, with our service providers, with
		educational institutions, with public authorities, or with other third parties. We will only
		share the minimum information necessary to fulfill the particular purpose. <strong
			>Impart does not sell personal information to other organizations.</strong
		> This section explains more about the sharing of information.
	</p>

	<h3>Within Impart</h3>

	<p>
		We may share personal information with our subsidiary and affiliate companies for the purposes
		described in the "Use of Personal Information" section above.
	</p>

	<h3>With Educational Institutions</h3>

	<p>
		If your school, university, or employer provides you with access to Impart's platform, we will
		share information about your usage, academic performance, assessment results, course progress,
		and other educational data with that institution. This enables the institution to fulfill its
		educational mission, track student progress, award credit, and comply with accreditation and
		regulatory requirements.
	</p>

	<h3>With Partner Organizations</h3>

	<p>We may share personal information with certain partners, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>

			co-hosts of that program or event.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have consented to disclosure or we have a lawful and legitimate business reason for
			disclosure.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>With Public Authorities</h3>

	<p>
		We may be required to disclose personal information to meet legal requests, court orders, or
		regulatory requirements, including national security or law enforcement requests.
	</p>

	<h3>With Other Third Parties</h3>

	<p>
		We will share personal information with other third parties if we believe it is necessary to
		comply with the law or legal process, to protect and defend our rights and property, to ensure
		the safety of our users or the public, or to prevent misuse of our platform and services. We
		may also share personal information during corporate transactions, such as a merger,
		acquisition, consolidation, or change of control.
	</p>

	<p>
		The sharing outlined in this section may involve any of the categories of personal information
		listed above, but only the minimum data necessary to fulfill each specific purpose.
	</p>

	<h2 id="marketing-and-opt-out">5. Marketing, Targeted Advertising, and Opting Out</h2>

	<p>
		Where allowed, and typically with your prior consent, Impart may use personal information to
		support direct marketing activities. This includes showing personalized advertisements online
		and sending targeted marketing communications, such as emails, to keep you updated with news,
		events, courses, and platform features. We tailor these messages to content we believe will
		interest you based on your usage and preferences.
	</p>

	<p>
		We may use third parties to display advertisements or send marketing information on our behalf,
		including online ads. We will not share personal information with third parties for their own
		marketing purposes without your informed consent. Impart may promote third-party educational
		products or services to you where lawfully allowed and where we believe it would be in your
		interest.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can opt out or object to the use of your information for direct marketing at any time. You
		can use the opt-out or unsubscribe mechanism in the communications you receive from us, or send
		a request to <a href="mailto:support@imparteducation.com">support@imparteducation.com</a>. You
		can also manage cookies for advertising purposes through your browser settings. If you opt out
		of marketing communications, we may retain minimal details to ensure we do not send you
		marketing in the future. You will still receive communications that are necessary to deliver or
		administer requested educational services.
	</p>

	<h2 id="international-transfers">6. International Transfers</h2>

	<p>
		Impart is based in the United States. We may transfer, store, or process personal information in
		any country where Impart or its service providers operate. This includes the United States and
		other countries where our cloud infrastructure providers maintain data centers. These countries
		may have privacy laws that do not provide the same level of protection as those in your country
		of residence. We take all necessary steps to ensure that personal information is treated
		securely and in accordance with all applicable data protection laws, including the use of
		appropriate contractual safeguards and security measures.
	</p>

	<h2 id="retention">7. Retention of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>
		We retain personal information only for as long as needed in relation to the purpose for which
		it was collected. We keep it for as long as necessary to provide educational services, maintain
		academic records, resolve disputes, or meet legal expectations (such as FERPA record retention
		requirements, reporting obligations, or accounting requirements). This is determined on a
		case-by-case basis and depends on factors such as the type of data, the reason we collected it,
		and our legal, educational, or operational needs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Academic records, including grades and course completion data, may be retained for extended
		periods to support transcript requests, degree verification, and institutional accreditation
		requirements.
	</p>

	<h2 id="security">8. Security of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>
		Impart takes the security, integrity, and confidentiality of personal information very
		seriously. We store personal information on our servers or those of our cloud infrastructure
		providers. Authorized employees, representatives, and agents can access that information as
		needed for the purposes described in this notice. We use various technical, administrative, and
		physical security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
		use, modification, or destruction. However, no method of safeguarding information can be
		guaranteed as completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
	</p>

	<h2 id="children">9. Children</h2>

	<p>
		We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose information from or about children under 18
		without their parent or guardian's consent. If you are under 18, you should not use Impart's
		platform or services without first getting consent from your parent or guardian.
	</p>

	<p>
		When educational institutions provide access to Impart for students under 18, the institution is
		responsible for obtaining appropriate parental consent as required by applicable laws, including
		the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States.
	</p>

	<h2 id="students">10. Students and FERPA</h2>

	<p>
		In the United States, certain student information may be governed by the Family Educational
		Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and
		gives parents and eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records.
	</p>

	<p>
		When Impart provides services to educational institutions, we may act as a "school official"
		with a legitimate educational interest in student records. In such cases, the educational
		institution remains responsible for FERPA compliance, and Impart processes student information
		under the institution's direction and in accordance with FERPA requirements.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more information about FERPA, please visit the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA website
		at: <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa" target="_blank"
			>https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa</a
		>
	</p>

	<h2 id="your-rights">11. Your Rights</h2>

	<p>
		The rights provided under data privacy laws vary by location, and we will respond to requests as
		required by relevant laws. You will not receive discriminatory treatment if you choose to
		exercise any of your privacy rights. This section provides more information about privacy rights
		and how to exercise them.
	</p>

	<h3>Privacy rights typically include:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Access to a copy of your personal information.</li>
		<li>Correction of any errors in your personal information.</li>
		<li>Deletion of your personal information.</li>
		<li>Restrictions or objections to how we process your personal information.</li>
		<li>Data portability (receiving your data in a structured, commonly used format).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		To exercise your rights, you can submit a request to Impart by email at <a
			href="mailto:support@imparteducation.com">support@imparteducation.com</a
		>. For the protection of all individuals' personal information, we will only process your
		request if we can reasonably verify your identity, or that you are authorized to act for the
		person whose personal information we hold.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you submit a request, we may ask for more information to verify your identity and help us
		comply with your request. We do not typically charge for the exercise of individual rights, but
		we reserve the right to apply a charge in exceptional cases if there is a business need and in
		compliance with relevant data privacy laws.
	</p>

	<p>
		In some situations, Impart provides services for and on behalf of educational institutions. In
		those cases, Impart may act as a "Processor" (or "Service Provider") under the instruction of
		those institutions. The institution, often referred to as the "Controller," holds overall
		responsibility for processing personal information and may be responsible for responding to
		individual rights requests. If you submit an enquiry or request to Impart that needs to be
		forwarded to your institution, we will let you know.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we cannot fulfill your request for any reason, we will provide an explanation. If you are
		dissatisfied with the response to your privacy request, you can appeal the response and we will
		review our decision. You can submit an appeal by contacting <a
			href="mailto:support@imparteducation.com">support@imparteducation.com</a
		>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have given your consent to processing, you can withdraw that consent at any time by
		contacting us.
	</p>

	<h2 id="questions-and-complaints">12. Questions and Complaints</h2>

	<p>
		Impart welcomes the opportunity to address instances where individuals feel that we haven't met
		their privacy expectations. If you have any questions or comments about Impart's use of your
		personal information, or if you wish to submit a complaint, please email us at <a
			href="mailto:support@imparteducation.com">support@imparteducation.com</a
		>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most countries give you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we
		would encourage you to contact us first so we can try to resolve your concerns.
	</p>

	<h2 id="third-party-websites">13. Links to Third-Party Websites</h2>

	<p>
		Impart's platform or services may include links to third-party websites, applications, or
		services not owned by Impart. These third-party sites may have their own privacy and data
		protection policies, which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review
		the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. We are not responsible for the privacy
		practices or content of third-party websites.
	</p>

	<h2 id="updates">14. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>
		We periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure it remains up to date. Any changes will be
		posted on this page with an updated effective date. If we make a significant change in how we
		collect, use, or share personal information, we will post a prominent notice or provide other
		notice as required by law. If necessary, we may request updated consent to continue processing
		your information. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information
		on our privacy practices.
