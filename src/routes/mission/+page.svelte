        Our Beginning
      </h2>
      <p class="text-stone-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In 2012, Frank Vahid, a computer science and engineering professor at UC Riverside, and Smita Bakshi, who brought academic expertise from UC Davis and a decade of high-tech industry experience, recognized that more than half of STEM students never completed their degrees. The issue was clear: expensive, dense textbooks failed to match how students learn. Facing this challenge, Frank and Smita founded zyBooks and created a better way to engage students.

        zyBooks reimagine learning materials from the ground up with a simple philosophy of "Less text, more action." Walls of text are replaced with interactive experiences: animations, question sets, hands-on tools, integrated homework, and real-world labs. With zyBooks, students learn by doing—a long-proven, more effective practice. Just as importantly, we set our prices at a fraction of the cost of traditional textbooks because we believe financial barriers shouldn't derail STEM careers.
