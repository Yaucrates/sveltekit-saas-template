# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can begin writing and running Python code, you’ll need to prepare your
computer with the right tools. This section will guide you through installing Python
and setting up a code editor, ensuring that you have everything you need to follow
along with the course.

## Installing Python

Python is the programming language we'll use throughout the course, and installing
it is the first step. We'll cover the process for Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure
compatibility regardless of your operating system.
1. Download the latest stable version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and **check the box to add Python to your PATH**—-this makes it
accessible from the command line.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python --version`.
You should see the version number displayed.

## Installing a Code Editor

Good code editors enhances your productivity with features like syntax highlighting,
code completion, and debugging tools. For this course, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
because of its lightweight design and powerful extensions. If you decide to go with
this option, make sure to follow the set up [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
If you'd like an alternative, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a good Python-specific code editor.

## Looking Forward

In the next lesson, we'll write and run your first Python program, introducing basic
syntax and the interactive shell.
